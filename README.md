Tools:
- Postman, Eclipse, Apache, Tomcat 9, Maven, Pivotal Tracker for user stories


2. A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.

We started the planning process with drawing out the ERD, figuring out the entities, their properties and how they are related with each other. 
Then we wrote user stories to break down the project into deliverables by feature. 
The next step was to set up our Spring project in Eclipse. 
We approached the different layers by Entity, so we created an entity then worked it’s features through the layers until we got to the Controller.
Earlier on we had to incorporate Security.
We did pair programming the whole way through the project. 
Then we connected the front end with the back end. The last thing we did was to Unit Test by Entity and through the layers again.


3. Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.

One of the most challenging parts was working on Security and incorporating  the Token
